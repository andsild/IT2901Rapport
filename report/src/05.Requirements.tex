\section{Requirements Specification}
According to the gantt chart (Fig 4.1) the team were supposed to update the
requirement specification starting from week 2 and continuing up until week
10. For us it was still the case that there were a clearly identifiable
requirement specifications phase. This was primarily from week 2 up to and
including week 4. The outcome from this three week process was heavily used in
order to establish agreement between us and the customer. This chapter
presents the result from this process. 

\subsection{Purpose and Scope of this Specification}
The purpose of the requirement specification document is to specify the
objectives for our end product. Requirements are written at different
levels of detail. This is to make it easy to communicate the requirements to
both business and technical parties. We have mainly written the functional
requirements as stories and then broken them into smaller pieces. This makes
the requirements easy to communicate to the customer, and succinct for the
developers. These stories can be viewed in appendix TODO.\ It is important to
recognize that our project only lasted for a few months. Thus, late changes
to requirements were inserted promptly and without revision control. This is
a common practice in agile development\footnote{\ Page 91, Sommersville}.
The advantage and reason we chose not to perform revision control, is that we
could save time in not formally documenting all changes.

The coverage of the requirements is intended to be a complete coverage
of the product. This implies that all features available from the
application domain is listed in our specification. What the requirements
specification does not cover are organizational and external requirements. This
follows from the small amount of administrative users and developers involved,
and trust between the customer and the developers.

\subsection{Process of the Requirement Specification}
The customer passed on an initial list of requirements to our group. After a
classification and organization of the features, we drafted scenarios and
internally discussed the implication to each requested feature. Therein, we saw
what features would be infeasible and additional features we would want to
introduce to the customer. The modified list of requirements was then presented
to the customer, before proceeding with the implementation of the end-product.
Throughout the entire development process both we and the customer have been
modifying the list of requirements.

\subsection{Product/service description}
In this section, you will find our interpretation of the physical user-domain.
The reader should note that some members of our group has competed earlier,
which has given us helpful empirical insight.

\subsubsection{Expected Physical Environment}
Our solution is used in different contexts. Table X.X has the different
application and user-domains.

\begin{tabular}{|m{3.1712599in}|m{3.1712599in}|}
\hline
IDI Open is hosted in P15, Høgskoleringen 3, on
Gløshaugen campus every year. Every team participating in the
contest get allocated their own computer. &
For offsite contestants, javascript must be enabled.\\
\hline
Software is required. A web server(Apache, Nginx), database
server(MySQL, PostgreSQL), Python with PyPi package manager.
 &
Linux kernel with ssh enabled, supplemented with a root user.
\\\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{User Characteristics}
Table X.X show different stereotypes of expected typical users. While open to
deviations from the stereotypes, they highlight important properties required
for our solution.

\begin{tabular}{|m{2.9837599in}|m{3.1087599in}|}
\hline
\begin{itemize}
    \item Irresponsive interfaces
    \item Incorrect data

\begin{itemize}
    \item User submission system
    \item Response types
\end{itemize}
 &
\begin{itemize}
    \item Irresponsive interfaces
    \item Node failures

\item Backend system\item

 &
\begin{itemize}
\item Dissatisfied contestants\item

\begin{itemize}
\item Nothing special\end{itemize}
\\\hline
and information
\begin{itemize}
\item Mis-information
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scoreboards, about competition
\end{itemize}
 &
\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

It can be seen in table X.X that the most prominent trait of our users is that
they have a background in computer science. As a consequence, it is assumed a
higher level of technical competence from our users. The user profiles also
highlight that some features were more important than others, e.g.\
responsiveness over aesthetics.

\subsection{Requirements}
Stories can be ambiguous and open for misinterpretation.\
we felt that a natural language specification of requirements would make it
easier to understand our application domain. To reduce miscommunication we made
sure to give each specification as short, succinct sentences. The stories were
used as a way to communicate with the customer about requirements without them
having to read through the table of requirements.

There are three different states for priorities, HIGH, MED and LOW.\
This ensured strict priorities.
Using more states would make it hard to differentiate between the priorities we
gave the requirements.

The following definitions make out the guideline for
prioritizing the requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item HIGH: The requirement is a ``must have''. To have a successfull product,
        the requirement must be implemented.
    \item MED: The requirement is a ``should have''. The fulfillment of the
        requirement will benefit the quality system.
    \item LOW: The requirement is a ``nice to have''. This includes functionality
        not critical to the system.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Functional}
The functional requirements are broken down in different categories.
Each category corresponds to a user group. The categories are Admin, Judge,
Contestant, Functionary, Teams, and Other. Each category has an ID, priority
and story. Table X.X shows the complete list of the requirements, while the
corresponding stories are given in appendix\ref{appendix:userstories}

The ID system can be interpreted in the following way
\begin{itemize}
    \item The F stands for Functional
    \item The second letter determines which category, e.g A stands for admin.
\end{itemize}

The milestone show when each requirement needs to be met.

\subsection{Requirements Not Met}
Most of the requirements on time.
There were some minor requirements not fulfilled mainly due to time
constraints. All of them were priority LOW.\ Here are the requirements
we did not complete:

\begin{center}
\begin{longtable}{|p{5cm}|l|}
\hline
A judge shall get a notification when received a question & FJ-09\\\hline
A functionary shall be able to register a balloon colour to each task/problem &
FF-01\\\hline
The system shall be able to gather a large variety of statistic specified by
the admin & FO-02\\\hline
\end{longtable}
\end{center}

The reason they were not completed was due to the their low priority and
time constraint. In addition to the unfinished requirements there were also 
requirements that were not met in an ideal way.
This was in agreement with the customer. These are the partially met
requirements:

\begin{longtable}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    An admin can add a node & FA-10 \\
    \hline
    An admin can remove a node & FA-11 \\
    \hline
    An admin can manage a node.  & FA-12 \\
    \hline
    Response from action & NF-01 \\
    \hline
    Logs will be backed up & NR-03 \\
    \hline
\end{longtable}

Unfortunately, an admin can only manage the execution nodes through the
code. This is planned to be fixed before the next contest. The response
time did unfortunately exceed 1.5 seconds during the contest. This was
due to a bad implementation of the high score list, detailed
in~\ref{reflection}. NR-03 had to be overruled during the contest. This is
discussed in detail in chapter TODO
\textit{development}.
