SA-01 & HIGH & Will be able to create a new contest. When doing so a new web
page should be created, but whether the site should be immediately published or
not is optional. The content of the new site follows a strict template, but
adding a custom css-file will be possible. Each contest has got its own
settings, containing a list of supported compiler profiles, compiler flags,
penalty system, maximum number of contestants, maximum number of contestants
per team, and of course a date and a name. When creating a contest the admin
needs to provide a name and a date, the other settings may be skipped and
default settings will be used.\\ \hline

SA-02 & HIGH & Users are organized in user groups(admin being one of them).
By default three usergroups are provided, admin, judge, contestant and
functionary. The entire solution is based on independent modules of
functionality and each user group has got access to a subset of these modules.
The admin is the only non-modifiable user group, admins have access to all
modules. The admins can modify all other user groups, change permissions of a
group and remove/add member to a group, this includes promoting new admins. The
admins are also able to deactivate users, and even remove them from the
database.  \\ \hline

username and password of a privileged user on that node. These nodes can also
be removed by the admins. The nodes can also be managed in terms of compiler
profile support.\\ \hline

 SA-05 & HIGH & The web page associated with a contest consists of a set of
news items, these can be added by the admin. As with the entire contest web
