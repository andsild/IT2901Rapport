than the other sprints. Instead of creating a sprint backlog, holding
all the tasks, we broke down the report into chapters. Some of which
was already finished. For each chapter we talked about what key ponts
we wanted to write about for so deciding a pair that should write that
part. Then, before we met next time, another pair would view, comments
and generally share some points about that chapter. \ }\\\hline
